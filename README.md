# Radar_Detection_System_Simulation

This is a Simulation based project, which focuses on application of Dijkstra's Algorithm to find shortest path between the Radar and any Unwanted Object

#  Radar Detection System (Simulation)

This project simulates a **pulse-based radar system** that detects aerial objects like UAVs in a 2D environment. 
It visually demonstrates radar pulse transmission, object detection, and return signal propagation using **Python and Matplotlib**.

## 

- Gaussian-modulated radar pulse simulation
- Animated 2D visualization of outgoing and returning pulses
- Application of Dijkstra's Algorithm
- Visualization of shortest path found
